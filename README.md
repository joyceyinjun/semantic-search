# Semantic Search

Semantic Search is based on full sentence analysis. Each sentence is a search unit. The sentences are vectorized via BERT language model. The engine looks for similarities in the vector space and returns **sentences** that are relevant in **meaning**, together with links to the original source of the article containing those sentences. Hence, a search in **semantics**.
